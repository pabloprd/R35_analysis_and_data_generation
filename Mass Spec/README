Mass Spectrometry README
Overview

This portion of the repository contains all code and datasets associated with the proteomics pipeline for the manuscript. It includes raw processed Excel outputs, downstream statistical analysis, differential protein expression, and visualization workflows.

As with Nanostring, only folders labeled R Code and Output contain active analysis components. The structure is intentionally parallel to maintain consistency across both datasets.

Folder Structure
1. R Code

Contains all R scripts used for:

Data import and formatting

Quality control (as applicable; Poochon data arrive preprocessed)

Statistical modeling (limma-based differential protein expression)

Pathway and ontology enrichment

Figure generation

Scripts follow a numbered naming convention to reflect the required order of execution.

2. Output

Contains all output files generated by the analysis workflow, including:

Differential expression tables

Enriched pathway and ontology results

Intermediate objects

Final manuscript-ready visualizations

Most outputs are provided as .xlsx tables for easy interpretation.

Workflow Order
Step 1 — Data Import and Preparation

Typical scripts include:

01_Import_and_Preprocessing.R
Loads Poochon-processed proteomics data and prepares objects for analysis.

02_QC_and_Filtering.R
Performs any additional quality checks and filters low-confidence proteins.

Step 2 — Statistical Analysis

Scripts generally include:

Differential protein expression using limma

Summary statistics

Fold-change and significance filtering

Generation of clean gene/protein-level tables

Step 3 — Enrichment and Ontology

Scripts cover:

GO biological processes

KEGG pathways

Additional enrichment analyses

Results appear in corresponding Output folders.

Step 4 — Visualization

Final scripts produce:

Volcano plots

Boxplots for significant proteins

Chord plots (if applicable)

PCA or clustering visualizations (if included in workflow)

Notes

Proteomics data from Poochon arrive preprocessed and normalized; scripts adjust for this and proceed directly to modeling.

All scripts are written in R 4.5.0.

Required packages are listed at the top of each script for easy installation.
