This folder contains all code and excel files related to the data processing and analysis of the R35 Nanostring data

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
R35 Nanostring Data Analysis
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Contains all the R code and excel tables related to the summary statistics and differential gene expression analysis


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
R35 Nanostring Data Preprocessing
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Contains all the R code and excel tables related to the preprocessing of the R35 Nanostring data. This includes the modification of metadata, the loading and combining of RCC files, quality control, normalization, and creating data tables with metadata markers


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
R35 Nanostring Data Visualization
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Contains all R code and excel tables related to the visualization of R35 Nanostring data (such as individual gene comparisons and total group comparisons). These include box plots, volcano plots, heat maps, histograms, etc. 


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
R35 Nanostring Original data
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


- Contains all the original data used for Nanostring data analysis in this project. These include the original unmodified metadata, the RCC files, etc.



Workflow:
Overview

This section of the repository contains all code, outputs, and workflow documentation for the Nanostring gene expression analysis used in the study. The structure is designed to walk users through preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization in a logical, reproducible order.

Only folders labeled R Code and Output contain active content.
Folders labeled Decommissioned Code or Nanostring Original Data are for archival storage and should not be modified or executed.

Folder Structure
1. R Code

Contains all R scripts required for data loading, preprocessing, normalization, statistical analysis, and figure generation.
Scripts are numbered to indicate the sequence in which they should be run.

2. Output

Contains all output files generated by the scripts in the R Code folder (primarily .xlsx tables).
Each file corresponds directly to the script that produced it.

Workflow Order
Step 1 — Nanostring Preprocessing

Folder: Nanostring_preprocessing/R Code
Scripts include:

01_Loading_QC_Normalization.R
Loads raw RCC files, performs quality control, and conducts normalization.

02_Metadata_Modification.R
Processes and formats sample metadata for downstream analysis.

These scripts must be run in this order.

Step 2 — Nanostring Analysis

Folder: Nanostring_analysis/R Code
Covers:

Summary statistics

ANOVA testing

Differential gene expression

Gene-level result tables

Gene ontology enrichment

Run the scripts sequentially based on their numeric prefixes.
