README

This repository contains all analysis code, datasets, and supporting documentation for the manuscript:

“Ancestry-Linked IL-10 Signaling and Macrophage Activation Modulate Fibroblast Responses to Oxidative Stress in a PEG-Based Microphysiological System.”

The repository is organized to allow clear, step-by-step reproduction of both the Nanostring (RNA expression) and Mass Spectrometry (proteomics) analyses. Each major component is separated into its own directory, with detailed instructions and ordered scripts to guide users from raw data to final figures.

Repository Structure
1. Mass Spectrometry

This folder contains all code, processed datasets, and documentation related to the proteomics analysis pipeline.
You will find:

A dedicated README describing preprocessing steps, normalization, statistical testing, and figure generation.

Sequentially numbered R scripts (e.g., 01_import.R, 02_QC.R, etc.) that reflect the recommended order of execution.

Output files and intermediate objects used to produce the proteomics figures included in the manuscript.

2. Nanostring

This folder includes all workflows related to Nanostring/RNA-seq data processing and analysis.
Inside, you will find:

A folder-specific README with instructions for running the pipeline.

Numbered R scripts covering data import, normalization, differential expression, QC, and visualization.

Supporting datasets and any metadata needed to fully reproduce results.

How to Use This Repository

Start by reviewing the README inside each analysis folder to understand the specific pipeline.

Follow the numbered R scripts in sequence—they are laid out to mirror the analysis workflow from start to finish.

Figures generated by these scripts correspond directly to those presented in the manuscript.

All scripts were written using R version 4.5.0 and rely on commonly used packages such as tidyverse, limma, and clusterProfiler.
Package requirements are listed within each folder.

Reproducibility and Contact

This repository is designed to be fully reproducible. If you encounter issues or have questions regarding the analysis steps, figures, or data organization, please reach out to the study authors.
